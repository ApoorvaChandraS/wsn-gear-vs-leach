Create a graph
 1)add nodes
 2)add edges with weights
 3)add energy list for nodes

2)Code the algorithm
3)Run the code

4)develop various test cases 
5)See about energy dissemination
6)First order radio model
   
 
Hitch :  Compute h(N,R) initally itself for all nodes and store in a data structure
Each time you want to transmit check if the neighbour is alive or not if you find a minima
